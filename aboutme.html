            <h2>My Profesional Background</h2>
            <div>
                <p>
                    I attended the University of Colorado, Boulder, and graduated in 2020 during a period of unprecedented uncertainty brought on by the global pandemic. Like many of my peers, I felt a deep sense of anxiety and fear about what the future might hold. 
                    As the world was grappling with the challenges of lockdowns and the shift to remote work, I found myself facing the daunting task of securing my first job in an unpredictable and rapidly changing environment.
                    The job market was, to say the least, difficult. Companies across the nation were either shutting down entirely or adapting to a fully remote workspace for the first time. This presented a new and unique challenge for me, one that required
                    resilience, adaptability, and a proactive approach. Through diligent networking and consistent self-improvement, I was able to secure my first role in finance at Advantage Futures, a futures and options clearinghouse in Chicago. While this 
                    wasn’t the exact path I had envisioned immediately after college, it proved to be an invaluable experience. I not only built lasting friendships but also gained a profound understanding of what is expected in a professional business environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During my time at Advantage Futures, I quickly realized the importance of continuous learning and upskilling in life after college. Recognizing that the job market is ever-evolving and increasingly competitive, I committed myself to ongoing
                    education and professional development. This commitment has been a cornerstone of my career and personal growth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After two years at Advantage, I decided to pursue my initial interest in commercial real estate. I was fortunate to secure a position at Accenture, where I could finally dive into the field I had originally set my sights on. However, my time at 
                    Accenture coincided with a period of significant layoffs within the company, which placed my job at risk. Faced with this uncertainty, I made the difficult decision to leave in search of greater job security.

                <p>
                    Shortly thereafter, I dedicated myself to furthering my qualifications in finance by studying for and passing the Series 63, 65, and 7 examinations. This accomplishment positioned me as a strong contender in the finance market, leading to my
                    current role as a Client Associate at Neuberger Berman, which I began in November of last year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over the past four years, I have experienced significant growth both personally and professionally. Each step of my journey has brought me closer to understanding who I am and what I truly want in my long-term career. After much reflection and 
                    exploration, I’ve come to the realization that my true passion lies in technology. Coding and tech have sparked a genuine interest in me, and I am now focused on making this field my long-term career path.

            <h2> Hobbies </h2>
            <div>   
                <p> 
                    I have a wide range of hobbies that span from the everyday to the adventurous. The outdoors has always been a significant part of my life, and I find great joy in activities like biking and skiing. Skiing, in particular, has been a lifelong passion. 
                    It’s something my family and I made a tradition of doing together at least once a year. This passion was further nurtured during my time at the University of Colorado, Boulder, where I took full advantage of the incredible skiing opportunities available nearby.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyond my love for outdoor activities, music has always held a special place in my heart. I began playing the guitar at a relatively young age, and it has been a constant companion in my life ever since. My musical journey didn’t stop there; over the years,
                    I’ve expanded my skills to include various software instruments. I’ve learned to play a drumpad and have become proficient with a digital audio workstation, particularly Logic Pro, which has allowed me to explore and create music in new and exciting ways.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Baseball, however, remains my first love and favorite sport. Growing up playing the game instilled in me a deep appreciation for teamwork, discipline, and the thrill of competition. While my interests have broadened over time, baseball will always be the sport
                    that holds a special place in my heart.

                <p> 
                    With a lifelong passion for learning and a deep appreciation for problem-solving, I’m excited to channel my creativity and analytical skills into the world of tech and coding. Just as I’ve pursued my hobbies like music and skiing with dedication, I’m eager to 
                    immerse myself in the dynamic and ever-evolving field of technology. I look forward to building a career where I can continue to grow, innovate, and make a meaningful impact.
